{"claims_holder":{"claims":["There is a statistically significant positive relationship between emotional awareness and academic performance, with students who have better academic performance showing higher scores in differentiating emotions, attending to others' emotions, and analyzing their own emotions","Students who failed the previous academic year obtained significantly lower scores in emotional awareness factors and happiness, and higher scores in sadness and anger","Emotional variables (attending to others' emotions, analyzing own emotions, differentiating emotions, verbal communication, and happiness) significantly predict academic performance, explaining 6.5% of the variance"]},"claims_all":[{"chain_of_thought":"Let me analyze this step by step:\n\n1. The claim is about the relationship between emotional awareness and academic performance\n2.
