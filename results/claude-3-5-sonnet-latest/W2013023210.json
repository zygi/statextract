Three of these trials compared colloid with hypertonic saline and account for 59 deaths (78%) between colloids and crystalloid.","In all cases of hypovolaemia the main priority is to restore the circulatory volume as quickly and efficiently as possible to prevent impairment of oxygen due to ischaemia and hypoxaemia."]},"claims_all":[{"chain_of_thought":"Let me analyze this claim carefully:\n\n1. The claim appears in the first paragraph of the paper, discussing a meta-analysis by Schierhout and Roberts.\n\n2.

Later in the text, it mentions \"They quote four trials with adequate concealment and say that there was an increase in the absolute risk of death of 4% with colloids.\"\n\n4.
