The claim is about the interaction between sex and attractiveness on altruism and cooperation\n2. Looking through the paper, this interaction effect is reported in Table 1\n3. For cooperation, the sex × attractiveness interaction shows F(1) = 9.63, p < .001\n4. For altruism, the sex × attractiveness interaction shows F(1) = 6.99, p < .01\n5. The claim is also described in the text in the Results section where it states \"MANCOVA revealed a significant interaction between attractiveness and sex, F (2, 179) = 7.33, p < .01\"\n6.
