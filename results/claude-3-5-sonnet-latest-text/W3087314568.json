The claim has two parts:\n   - The significant difference between stratified and batch normalization\n   - The specific accuracy numbers achieved\n\n3. For the significance, I can find in the Results section: \"A strong effect of the normalization method was captured as well (F(1, 168) = 33.8, p < 0.001, ηp[2] = 0.17)\"\n\n4. The accuracy numbers (91.6% and 79.6%) appear in multiple places, but are first mentioned in the abstract.\n\n5. Since this is a core finding that appears in the abstract, I'll use the abstract location and the p < 0.001 value that supports the significance claim.\n\n6.
