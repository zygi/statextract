The claim appears in multiple places, but is most clearly stated in the Results section\n2. The key statistical test is a 2x2 MANCOVA testing the interaction between attractiveness and sex\n3. The exact statistics are reported: \"MANCOVA revealed a significant interaction between attractiveness and sex, F (2, 179) = 7.33, p <.01, ƞp2 = 0.08\"\n4. This appears on page 11 of the paper in the Results section\n5.
