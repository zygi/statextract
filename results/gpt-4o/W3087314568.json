Specifically, it refers to the accuracy rates achieved for both two and three emotion categories.

These will likely be in the results section or depicted in a table or figure, where p-values are often explicitly mentioned in relation to performance outcomes.","specific_choice":"Classification accuracy of 91.6% for two emotion categories with stratified normalization.","p_value":"p=0.05","claim_location_type":"figure","claim_bounding_box_page_num":4,"claim_bounding_box":[160,200,640,605]},{"chain_of_thought":"The claim explicitly states a p-value for the statistical results of the labeling method, including an F-statistic and partial eta squared.
