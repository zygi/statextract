This is specifically mentioned in the results section and possibly supported by data in tables. First, I would locate the section where the results are discussed, particularly focusing on sections that compare group differences in physical self-efficacy scores. Additionally, tables accompanying this section may provide explicit p-values or indicate significance levels through annotations such as asterisks. In this paper, Table 1 might contain relevant statistical comparisons including p-values, as it discusses demographic, anthropometric, questionnaire scores, and VO2 max data, which are directly related to this context.","specific_choice":"Physical self-efficacy scores comparison between HW and OW girls","p_value":"p<0.01","claim_location_type":"text","claim_bounding_box_page_num":2,"claim_bounding_box":[380,74,395,241]},{"chain_of_thought":"First, I looked for specific mention of the claim regarding the difference in VO2 max values between HW and OW girls.
