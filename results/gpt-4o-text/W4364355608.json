{"claims_holder":null,"claims_all":[{"chain_of_thought":"The paper mentions that patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) exhibit reduced performance and prolonged reaction times, particularly at high working memory (WM) loads, in comparison to healthy controls. This specific claim seems related to a comparison between two groups: MDD patients and healthy controls, under high WM load conditions in an n-back task. The paper's results section and tables should contain p-values associated with these observations.\n\nChecking Table 1 from the provided paper segment, which includes the demographic data and some performance metrics on the n-back task, where claims about performances and p-values might be reported is an appropriate section to focus on. \n\nIndeed, in Table 1, there is mention of Performance at 3-Back showing a significant difference with a p-value explicitly marked as p < 0.001, aligning with the claim given.","specific_choice":"The claim refers to the comparison of n-back performance and reaction times between MDD patients and healthy controls, particularly at high loads like 3-back performance and overall reaction times.","p_value":"p < 0.001","claim_location_type":"text","claim_bounding_box_page_num":1,"claim_bounding_box":[0,0,100,100]},{"chain_of_thought":"The claim is about the correlation between physical fitness and neural activity in the left superior parietal lobule (Peak2), as presented in Table 3 of the paper.
